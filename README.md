# 100 Days of Code â€“ My Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to projects from the Udemy course **"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"**.

In some cases, I found that my approach could be simpler than the one provided in the course, or I tried to solve problems based only on the knowledge learned so far, without using unfamiliar functions. I created this repo to document these alternative solutions and track my learning progress.

Feel free to explore or suggest improvements!
